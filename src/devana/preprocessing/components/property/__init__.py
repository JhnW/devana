"""A property is a set of data that can be assigned to any element of code and serves as a description of how the
preprocessor should transform the code or generate side effects.

Typically, property comes from comments or attributes. This module includes components that allow you to easily
complement your own property support - configure how they are to be parsed, how to operate, and add further
processing functions."""
